## Using the project

First of all, make sure your *osu!* installation pathing is located at `C:/osu`, your beatmap folder should be named `beatmap-637104724336517424-audio`

After that, clone the repository inside the projects folder in the storybrew installation.

## TODO List
* [ ] Properly timestamps of the content to the storyboard.
* [ ] The primary effects (eg. Particles, HitObjects Highlight, Animated Sprites, etc)
* [ ] Color Matching with the diffs
* [ ] Music Lyrics
* [ ] Many other things that i'm lazy to put here.
